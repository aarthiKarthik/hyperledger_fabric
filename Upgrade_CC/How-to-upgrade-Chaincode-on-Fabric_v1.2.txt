How to Upgrade chaincode on Hyperledger Fabric:

This writeup shows how to deploy and then upgrade chaincode written in Go for the BYFN sample network and the marbles private data collection chaincode on Fabric v 1.2.0.

Deploying the 'fisrt-network' and playing with chaincode:
The steps mentioned below are explained in detail in this tutorial: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/private_data_tutorial.html

1) Tear down existing containers using: byfn.sh -m down
2) Bring up the new network with: byfn.sh up -c mychannel -s couchdb -i 1.2.0
3) Open a  bash shell into the cli container by: docker exec -it cli bash
4) Install v1.0 chaincode on all peers
5) Instantiate the chaincode v1.0
6) Initmarble, query etc for "marbel1"

Upgrading Chaincode:
1) Update the same chaincode file (see attached file modified with an addl. Timestamp field added to the marbles data type) within the global chaincode folder.
2) Build the chaincode using Go (go build xxx.go) and verify if there are no compile issues.
3) Copy the chaincode into the cli container by:
   docker cp marbles_private_chaincode.go cli:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/chaincode/marbles02_private/go/marbles02_private_chaincode.go
   (make sure chaincode name is the same)
3) Install on all peers using exactly the same chaincode name and v2.0 (same as step 4 above, with ver number changed)
4) Upgrade chaincode using: peer chaincode upgrade -o orderer.... -v 2.0 (same as instantiate in step 5, with both the keyword and version numbers changed)
5) Invoke chaincode function to initMarble with a new marble2 and additional timestamp value
6) Query the chaincode for the newly added parameter
